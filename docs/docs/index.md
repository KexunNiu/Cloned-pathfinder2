# Project Requirements
## Executive Summary

This project aims to build on an existing web platform created for the [Skillcity Institute](https://www.skillcity.ca/). The web platform would help young people build their career pathways for the future. This project will allow organizations to create and manage postings for various opportunities that they provide. Young people will be able to view, search, and filter these opportunities, apply for them if applicable, and connect with the organizations offering them. Administrators will be able to customize the fields available on users' profiles. The users of this website would be young people (i.e. regular users), mentors, companies, and administrators.



## Project Glossary
- **Activities:** Activities available to users, can earn users badges.

- **Admin:** A website administrator that has access to the admin dashboard. Admins can manage users and add content to the site.
